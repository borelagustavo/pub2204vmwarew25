# Preparing Ubuntu 22.04 for VMware Workstation

You will be installing and configuring VMware Workstation PRO 25 on a Linux Ubuntu 22.04 machine.

To run the scripts, you need to grant permissions. Another detail: the VMware installer must be in the same folder where you will run the script.

```
chmod +x setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh
```
