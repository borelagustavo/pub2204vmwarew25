# Preparing Ubuntu 22.04 for VMware Workstation

You will be installing and configuring VMware Workstation PRO 25 on a Linux Ubuntu 22.04 machine.

To run the scripts, you need to grant permission. Also, the VMware installer must be in the same folder where you will run the scripts. This process is repeated for each file.

```
chmod +x install_vmware.sh
```
```
sudo ./install_vmware.sh
```
